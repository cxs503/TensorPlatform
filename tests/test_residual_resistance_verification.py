"""
Residual Resistance Coefficient (Cr) Verification — Mission m1772

The platform's resistance model uses an empirical residual-resistance coefficient::

    Cr = 0.002 * (1 + 2*Cb) * Fn^2.5    (Fn > 0.05)
    Cr = 0                                (Fn <= 0.05)

This formula has **no published provenance** — it is a curve fit calibrated on
SUBOFF-like axisymmetric bodies.  This test suite:

1. Verifies the mathematical properties of the formula (monotonicity, continuity,
   scaling with Cb and Fn).
2. Compares Cr against published residual-resistance data for three benchmark
   hulls (SUBOFF, DTMB-5415, KVLCC2) to quantify the model error.
3. Documents the applicability limits: the formula is NOT a general merchant-ship
   resistance method (no Holtrop wave/bulb/transom terms).
